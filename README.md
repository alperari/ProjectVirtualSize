# Virtual Size App



This is a mobile project that is built to help and guide people while shopping online.

Since it can sometimes be hard to determine or understand if a clothing fits well or will be loose on your body just by checking size, this app will help you understand which product will be fit well or not.



Algorithm behind this project filters products according to your body measures and gives you information about products' suitability.



Firebase is used for backend solution.
